This project requires me to implement a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier and, thereafter, calculate the resulting metrics.

  **Project description**

  **Naive Bayes Classifier**
My goal is to predict if a new sms is spam or non-spam. I assume that is much worse misclassify non-spam than misclassify an spam. 

The reason is because people normally don't check the spam messages.
The two possible situations are:
New spam sms in my inbox. (False negative).
OUTCOME: I delete it.
New non-spam sms in my spam folder (False positive).
OUTCOME: I probably don't read it.
 
 **K-nearest neighbour**
 This analysis aims to develop a prediction model using KNN to determine whether or not a passenger would survive on the titanic.
  The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.
It took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. 
The Objective of this notebook is to give an idea how the workflow in KNN modeling problem is. How do we check features, how do we add new features and some other Machine Learning Concepts. 

**This project uses python libraries to conduct create the models and analyse the data**
